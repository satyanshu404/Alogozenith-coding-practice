Description
You are given an array of N integers. Find the longest subarray with distinct characters.

Input Format
The first line of the input contains one integer T - the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains one integer N - the length of the array. 

The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers.

Output Format
For each test case, print the longest subarray with distinct characters.

Constraints
1≤ T ≤ 105

1≤ N ≤ 105

1≤ Ai ≤ 109

It is guaranteed that the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 105.
