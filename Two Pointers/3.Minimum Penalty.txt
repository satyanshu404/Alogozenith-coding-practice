Description
Given an array of N integers and an integer D. Consider all subarray with length D, the penalty of the subarray is the number of distinct elements present in the subarray.
Find a subarray of length D with minimum penalty. Print the minimum penalty.

Input Format
The first line contains T, the number of test cases (1<=T<=10000).

The first line contains two space-separated integers N, D where 1<=N<=10^6, 1<=D<=N.

Next line contains N space-separated integers (0<=Ai<=1e6).

The Sum of N across all test cases â‰¤ 5*10^6.

Output Format
For each test case print the minimum penalty in a newline.
