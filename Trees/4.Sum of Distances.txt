Description
You are given a tree consisting of n nodes. d(u, v) is the distance between nodes u and v, or number of edges in between the path connecting two nodes u and v. Your task is to find the sum of distances over all possible pairs of nodes.

Input Format
The first input line contains an integer n: the number of nodes. The nodes are numbered 1, 2, …, n.
Then there are n − 1 lines describing the edges. Each line contains two integers a and b: there is an edge between nodes a and b.

Output Format
Print the sum as mentioned in the problem statement.

Constraints
1 ≤ n ≤ 2 x 10^5
1 ≤ a, b ≤ n
