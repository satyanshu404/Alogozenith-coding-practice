Description
You are given a tree consisting of n nodes. Find the center of a tree. If there exist multiple centers, print -1.

Input Format
The first input line contains an integer n: the number of nodes. The nodes are numbered 1, 2, …, n.
Then there are n − 1 lines describing the edges. Each line contains two integers a and b: there is an edge between nodes a and b.

Output Format
Print the center of a tree. If there exist multiple centers, print -1.

Constraints
1 ≤ n ≤ 2 x 105
