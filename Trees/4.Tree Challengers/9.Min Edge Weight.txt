Description
You are given a weighted tree of N nodes. D(u,v) is defined as the minimum weight of edge in the simple path from u to v.  Find the summation of D(u,v) for all 1≤u≤N, 1≤v≤N, where u<v.

Input Format
The first line of input contains one integer T (1 ≤ T ≤ 105) — the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains an integer N - the number of nodes in the tree (1 ≤ N ≤ 105).
The next N-1 line of each test case contains 3 space-separated integers u, v, w  denoting that there is an edge between node u and node v of weight w. (1 ≤ u,v ≤ N), (1 ≤ w ≤ 109 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 106.

Output Format
For each test case print the summation of D(u,v) for all 1≤u≤N, 1≤v≤N, where u<v in a new line.
