Input Format
The first line of the input contains one integer T - the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains one integer N - the length of the array. 

The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers.

Output Format
For each test case, print the minimum number of seconds needed to destroy all the gemstones.
