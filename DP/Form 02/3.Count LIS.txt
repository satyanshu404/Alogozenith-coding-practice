Description
Given an integer array arr, output the number of longest increasing subsequences.
Notice that the sequence has to be strictly increasing.

Input Format
First line contains 
T - the number of test cases.
First line of each test case contains n - the length of the array arr.
Second line of each test case contains array arr.

Output Format
For each test case, output the number of longest increasing subsequences in a newline modulo 1000000007.

Constraints
1≤T≤100
1≤n≤1000
10^−6 ≤arr[i]≤10^6
