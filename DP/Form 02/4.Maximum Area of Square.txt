Description
Given a grid of size n*m with 0s and 1s, you need to find the area of the largest square containing only 1.

Input Format
The first line of the input contains one integer t - the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers n, m - the size of the grid.

Each of the next n lines contains m space-separated integers, aij - the number at that cell.

Output Format
For each test case, print the maximum area.

Constraints
1 ≤ t ≤ 105

1 ≤ n, m ≤ 103

0 ≤ aij ≤ 1

It is guaranteed that the sum of n*m over all test cases does not exceed 107.
