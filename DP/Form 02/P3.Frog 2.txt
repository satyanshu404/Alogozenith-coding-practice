Problem Statement
There are N stones, numbered 1,2,…,N. For each i (1≤i≤N), the height of Stone i is hi.

There is a frog who is initially on Stone 1. He will repeat the following action some number of times to reach Stone N:
If the frog is currently on Stone i, jump to one of the following: Stone i+1,i+2,…,i+K. Here, a cost of |hi−hj∣ is incurred, where j is the stone to land on.
Find the minimum possible total cost incurred before the frog reaches Stone N.

Constraints
All values in input are integers.
2≤N≤10^5
1≤K≤100
1≤hi≤10^4
 
Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

N K
h1 h2 … hN

Output
Print the minimum possible total cost incurred.

Sample Input 1
5 3
10 30 40 50 20

Sample Output 1
30
If we follow the path 1 → 2 → 5, the total cost incurred would be ∣10−30∣+∣30−20∣=30.

Sample Input 2
3 1
10 20 10

Sample Output 2
20
If we follow the path 1 → 2 → 3, the total cost incurred would be ∣10−20∣+∣20−10∣=20.

Sample Input 3
2 100
10 10

Sample Output 3
0
If we follow the path 1 → 2, the total cost incurred would be ∣10−10∣=0.

Sample Input 4
10 4
40 10 20 70 80 10 20 70 80 60

Sample Output 4
40
If we follow the path 1 → 4 → 8 → 10, the total cost incurred would be ∣40−70∣+∣70−70∣+∣70−60∣=40.
